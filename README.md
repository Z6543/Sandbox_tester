# Sandbox_tester


## Introduction
This package consists of a malware analysis sandbox tester tool, a DNS server, and an HTTP server,
all written in Python. If the tool is executed on a sandbox, it will leak environment data to the 
configured servers. This information can be used to build better anti-sandbox solutions.

## Requirements
### Requirements on the HTTP/DNS server-side
Python 2.7

### Requirements on the builder side
Python 2.7<br/>
py2exe, pywin32, PIL, requests<br/>
7Zip (7z binary added to PATH)

### Requirements in the malware execution environment
WinXP - Win10

## Quick setup guide
1. Change the global configuration variables in:<br/>
	global_config.ini<br/>

	target = `<YOUR_DOMAIN>`<br/>
	listen_ip = `<YOUR_IP>`

2. Setup DNS
	Let's say you own a domain called `<YOUR_DOMAIN`>, and you want to host your DNS and HTTP server on it,
	and you have the IP of `<YOUR_IP>`. The following config creates a new nameserver (ns.`<YOUR_DOMAIN>`), 
	which will resolve all subdomain requests to tt.`<YOUR_DOMAIN>`. This is needed to set up the DNS server.

	```
	A (Host):
		host: @
		points to: <YOUR_IP>

		host: tt
		points to: <YOUR_IP>

	Cname(Alias):
		host: ns
		Points to: @

	NS record:
		host: tt
		points to: ns.<YOUR_DOMAIN>
	```

3. Start the http_server.py and dns_server.py on your server.

4. Build a new executable with:
	python setup.py
	Locate your final executable in dist/sandbox_tester_sfx.exe

6. Upload sandbox_tester_sfx.exe to the sandbox, wait to finish analysis.

7. Check results in http.db, dns.db or in the report. If the result is in the report, 
use filename_decrypt_send.py on a txt file where the created filenames are listed. 

8. PROFIT!

## Known issues
  * Some commands are buggy on XP - but it is safe to assume that if it is XP it is a sandbox ;) 
  * Some results are not forwarded on non-English systems, like Russian or Chinese
